# CashCoin
We are going to work api and retrofit and json in this application. And we are going to display the price list of digital currencies very nicely along with their charts

In this project I used retrofit,And I requested an API to the CryptoCompare site
In this program, you can see the latest and popular news at the top of the page
And the market list will be displayed for you. I used 10 coins in this list
But if you want to see more coins, you can click on the more button.

By clicking on each coin, you can see the coin chart, the price, the amount of change, the type of algorithm, and whether the price is high or low.
